What I love about computer science is the ability to put a certain amount of creativity into my work.

I believe that self-training, experimenting with new technologies and staying up to date with technological
progress is a fundamental part of our work, that part that makes it unique and fascinating.

During my free time I love running, biking, watching science fiction movies and astronomy.

The speed of light prevents us from traveling in space but allows us to travel back in time and understand the wonders that surround us.
